a loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code. There are two main types of loops in Python:

For Loop: This type of loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.

syntax :

[1,2,3,4,4]

for var in sequence:
    # block of code
    # do something with var


While Loop: This type of loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax: 
while condition:
    # do something
