"OOP" stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. Each object can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.

Here are some key concepts :

Classes: Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes and methods that an object will have. For example, you might have a class called Car with attributes like color and brand, and methods like drive() and stop().

Objects (Instances): Objects are instances of classes. When you create an object from a class, you're creating a specific instance of that class with its own set of data and methods.

Attributes: Attributes are the properties or data associated with a class or object. For instance, in a Car class, color and brand could be attributes.

Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that can operate on the attributes of that class. In the Car class example, drive() and stop() could be methods.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. For example, you might have a Vehicle class with common attributes and methods shared by different types of vehicles, and then subclasses like Car and Motorcycle that inherit from Vehicle.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, typically a class. It allows for better control over the accessibility of data and prevents unintended changes.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables flexibility and extensibility in code design. For instance, different types of vehicles might have their own implementations of a drive() method, but you can treat them uniformly as instances of a common Vehicle superclass.
